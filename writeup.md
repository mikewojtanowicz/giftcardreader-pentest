The road to debugging this program was long and painful. I initially started on an M1 processor, and the lack of x86 architecture made it incredibly difficult to properly utilize the various libraries recommended throughout this lab. The gdb debugger was especially difficult to utilize, and I spent hours upon hours troubleshooting possible fixes. This issue was consistent across the parts.

From there, I was able to appropriately analyze the flow of giftcardreader.c against the examplefile and some test cases that I believed could manipulate
